# Sketch-Pad

This is a simple vanilla JavaScript, CSS, and HTML project. Its a sketchpad that lets you draw on the grid as you actively hover over each quadrant!

Let me show you how it works!


As mentioned earlier, simply hover over the squares to draw!

You can click the rainbow button below to draw random coloured squares.
When you would like to revert back to black squares, simply slick the black button.

You can also reset the grid by clicking the grid reset button. This allows you to
specify the dimensions of the grid. The maximum cap for this is 64x64.
